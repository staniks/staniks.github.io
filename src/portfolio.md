# Portfolio

Unfortunately, I cannot share some of the most interesting stuff I have worked on, since it's proprietary code. The rest is here.

## Recent Projects

* [wadjet](https://github.com/staniks/wadjet) - a modern, thin wrapper around UDP sockets. Features error handling based on [std::expected standard proposal](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p0323r10.html).
* [Serious Engine Networking - Analysis](/articles/serious-engine-networking-analysis) - a delve into the inner workings of Serious Sam multiplayer tech, reverse-engineered from the original Serious Engine source code published by Croteam on GitHub.
* [Worship](/articles/worship) - 3D first-person shooter. Features a cross-platform game framework written in modern C++. Originally intended as a sequel to Inferno, it was decoupled while maintaining the artwork style and general feel.
* [Inferno](/articles/inferno) - first-person shooter game, written in C++. Uses raycasting for rendering.

## Projects during university

**Note:** projects listed here do not include projects for university courses. They're not really worth mentioning.

Most of these sources were lost due to being kept in an offline version control - back then, Github didn't allow storing lots of binary files.

* [Solar](https://staniks.itch.io/solar) - a puzzle game based on boolean logic gates. Used Unity.
* [Evolving eater AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMN9yNbgo1g) - an exercise in genetic algorithms.
* [Procedural sprites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoOjqsUmJfU) - simple procedural sprites in a tower-defense game.
* [Rays of Ra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8GAnbynj9A) - a children's game implemented in Unity.
* [Flocking behavior simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQA9Zshky78) - a simulation of bird-like flocking behavior. Used C++ and OpenGL.

## Projects during high-school

* [QuadAssault](https://github.com/staniks/quad-assault) - a top-down shooter written in C++. Uses OpenGL and deferred rendering technique to render a great number of lights without significant performance penalty. In hindsight, the code is terrible, but somewhat decent for someone in high-school. Gameplay video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHDXOadATTU).
* [Ancient Carnage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK1NjaEkIRg) - this was one of my first games in C++. Unfortunately, the source code was lost.
